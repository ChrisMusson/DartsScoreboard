## Darts Scoreboard
A basic Flutter project that keeps track of the score of a match of X01 darts.

## Usage
1. Ensure flutter is installed on your machine
1. Clone this repository
1. Open an emulator and run `flutter run` within the cloned repository's folder

Alternatively, in the `.apks/` folder, I have included the `.apk` files that can be downloaded directly onto an Android device. To find out which one is compatible with your Android device, you will need to find out which Android ABI your device uses. If you don't know or can't find out, then the `armeabi-v7a` ABI is by far the most common, so it is worth trying that one first.
